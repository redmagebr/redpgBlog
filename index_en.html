                RedPG is a web application that provides the tools to conduct a tabletop RPG session online. The main functions of this application include: specialized chat rooms with dice, characters, actions, sound effects, music, combat tracker, language tracker and many more; control and storage of character sheets.
            </p>
            <p>
                RedPG was also built from the ground-up to be customizable. Users can create their very own character sheets with all the automation they want and then just jump in on the action. It's also possible to alter RedPG itself - the client can be downloaded and edited directly, being made of pure HTML5 goodness!
            </p>
            <p>
                Being a web application, RedPG will run on any device with a web browser. However, the application was made for and tested in Desktop Google Chrome.
                <b>
                    While RedPG will work on most browsers, browsers that aren't Chrome might perform considerably worse, particularly on Mobile devices.
                </b>
                For your enjoyment, it's recommended that Google Chrome (or a derivative, such as Chromium) is used when accessing this application.

                <a href='http://redpg.com.br/img/lang_en.png' target='_blank'>Languages:</a> It is possible to have a character speak a different language. The true meaning of the text will not be shown to any player incapable of understanding that language (which can be set up in a special menu).

                <a href='http://redpg.com.br/img/combattracker_en.png' target='_blank'>Combat Tracker:</a> A combat tracker exists to assist storytellers in managing the character turn order.

            <p>
                <a href='http://redpg.com.br/img/sheet.png' target='_blank'>Character Sheets:</a> The system utilizes HTML5 to generate and display character sheets. It's possible to create a fully customized character sheet with just a little bit of HTML, while also adding automation through Javascript. The system includes a few sheet types by default (a Generic type that allows one to add as many fields as necessary and a Map sheet type, that holds a map with as many character tokens as you want).

            <p>
                <a href='http://redpg.com.br/img/interface_en.png' target='_blank'>Interface:</a> With a clean and minimalist interface, you will not be distracted from your RPG while still getting all the information you need. The interface will also adapt itself to your screen resolution, so it will always look "right".
